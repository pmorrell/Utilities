#   This script is designed to modify SNP names, but could be used for any \
#   type of transformation between lists of names (by changing the rows \
#   or columns it works on.) \
#   Alchmey genotype files http://alchemy.sourceforge.net have a standard \
#   format with four rows of comments followed by and empty comment line \
#   a header, and then data in 12 columns.
